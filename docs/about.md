# About Solveig

Solveig is an AI agent framework built on the principle that powerful AI tools should be both capable and trustworthy. While other AI assistants operate on an "ask forgiveness" model, Solveig implements a consent-first approach that puts users in complete control.

## Key Features

**Consent Model**: Every operation requires explicit user approval by default. Solveig shows you exactly what it plans to do, asks permission for file operations and commands, and supports granular pattern-based configuration for trusted directories.

**Safe by Design**: Prioritizes direct file operations over shell commands. Supports no-commands mode, directory isolation, and read-only operation for maximum safety.

**Plugin Architecture**: Extensible system with Requirements (new AI capabilities) and Hooks (pre/post-processing). Add new functionality without modifying core code.

**Provider Independence**: Works with any OpenAI-compatible API, plus native support for OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, and local models.

**Visual Interface**: Styled terminal output with progress tracking, clear task breakdowns, and rich metadata display.

## FAQ

**What is Solveig?**
A safety-first AI agent that bridges language models to your filesystem and shell with explicit user consent and visual transparency.

**Is Solveig an LLM like ChatGPT?**
No, Solveig is an agentic bridge that connects any language model to your computer's files and commands, with safety controls and user oversight.

**Is Solveig safe to run?**
Solveig prioritizes safety with clear information displays, sensible defaults, and comprehensive testing (127 tests, 88% coverage). However, it's ultimately a connection between an LLM and your computer's files and shell, which carries inherent risks. You remain responsible for any operations you approve.

**How does Solveig work?**
The AI analyzes your request, creates a plan with specific requirements (read files, run commands, etc.), displays this plan with clear descriptions, asks for your permission, then executes approved operations and shows results.

**Why are there 2 types of plugins?**

## Market Comparison

Solveig shares a space with several other tools, mature and with better user adoption that you should reasonably
consider as alternatives. I believe Solveig offers a unique combination and intend for the project to both offer
unique feature sets that no other tool does (like plugins) while also striving to make it the best at core shared
features like user interface and granular consent modules. I still think all of these tools are worth using and
I myself have tried some of them.

* **[Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code)** The current golden standard for a CLI AI assistant.
It's a feature-superset of Solveig, offering all of its capabilities while being a much more mature project
with a richer user interface. It supports state persistence through features like CLAUDE.md that I plan to add.
It has full planning capabilities, with task lists, retry mechanisms and fallbacks.
However, it only supports Claude as a model and has no extensibility through plugins. It's also missing some
relevant configurations, like no-command mode or explicitly restricting file access to a certain path.
I used Claude Code extensively in the development of Solveig, and it served as a comparison for usability
and feature set. Several features and visual quirks were heavily inspired from Claude's user interface, like
the "Waiting..." animations.

* **[Cline](https://cline.bot/)** an open-source IDE extension available for VS Code and Jetbrains. It's focused
on assisting developers and supports multiple providers. It has a simple consent model, supports rich browser
interaction for web applications (it can even take screenshots of web pages!), and can have new functionality
added on-the-fly through a [Model Context Protocol](https://github.com/cline/cline?tab=readme-ov-file#add-a-tool-that).
Overall Cline seems like a very powerful and mature tool, but the fact that it relies on an IDE just sets it
fundamentally apart from Solveig.

* **[Cursor](https://cursor.com/)** - An AI-first code editor built as a fork of VS Code rather than a CLI assistant.
It focuses on in-editor AI integration with features like Tab completion, inline code generation and an Agent mode
that can autonomously complete coding tasks. Cursor supports multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, xAI)
and has a Privacy Mode where code never leaves the user's machine.
It has huge adoption and excels at providing an AI-native IDE experience with features like codebase indexing and
multi-file editing.
It's fundamentally a GUI application rather than a CLI tool. This makes it more comparable to VS Code with AI
extensions than to command-line assistants like Solveig.
Cursor has a very interesting consent mechanism - users control how in control they want to be through an
"autonomy slider" that changes what the assistant has to ask for permission for. This enables features like
fully-integrated task planning, however it's more about pre-allowing file operations within the project
directory that the editor is working on, and not so much a system-wide permission system.

* **[Open Interpreter](https://github.com/openinterpreter/open-interpreter)** - OI is an interpreter for commands and
code generated by an LLM. It supports Shell commands as well as multiple languages like JS and Python.
It can be run in multiple ways - as a CLI tool, as a library integrated into another project and even as a desktop
app, and is very configurable.
Open Interpreter seems to take user safety seriously, with clear warnings and an experimental Safe Mode.
However, it has no built-in File API meaning it relies on commands for every operation, which is a valid concern.
Its permission model is also a basic Yes/No prompt and it currently has no plugin extensibility.
I'm thinking of adopting some of their functional features, like offering a similar Semgrep shell analysis plugin
[similar to their Safe Mode](https://github.com/OpenInterpreter/open-interpreter/blob/main/docs/SAFE_MODE.md) or
use the same strategy for [token counting with reasonable fallbacks](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/completion/token_usage#2-cost_per_token).

* **[Aider](https://aider.chat/)** - Possibly the closest tool to what Solveig tries to offer. It supports all of
its core features, including provider choice, a file API alongside command execution, and is intensely focused
on development assistance. The flow and functionality is very similar to what Solveig already does, while being
a much more mature and project with real testing from user adoption.
I think its interface is honestly the biggest drawback, it's very simple basic and the consent model is a basic
Yes/No compared to our granular permissions. Despite that the UI still has some very nice features, like a
very good file diff view with linting that I'm thinking of adopting eventually. 
It has no extensibility through plugins, but Aider itself can be integrated into an IDE through plugins.
One of its most interesting features is having a shorthand command to [scrape a webpage using playwright with a
command](https://aider.chat/docs/install/optional.html#enable-playwright). It's also very configurable.
Honestly, give Aider a try, it's a very useful tool  - people have built businesses using it.


## Design Principles

These are the core principles I use when creating Solveig:

- **Balance safe defaults with configurability** Solveig has to be as safe as possible for casual users while
offering deep configurability to power users. It should enforce sane default behavior like allowing command execution
while requiring explicit consent for all operations. We should also acknowledge that different users and scenarios
will benefit from extensive and granular configuration, from a very safety-concerned user who prefers to run Solveig
entirely without commands, to someone running it in a VM with everything auto-approved or someone testing a local
model. We should strive for very granular permissions using glob patterns and negative patterns.

- **File API over Shell commands:** Filesystem operations through our File API are safer than shell execution,
and this has to be reflected across the project. The system prompt instructs the model to prioritize File
Requirements and the configuration allows excluding commands entirely.

- **Plugin extensibility:** New capabilities should be additive, not require core modifications. Plugins
have to be simple drop-in files, easy to develop, with a clear integration into any project components.
This creates a new and more independent avenue for project expansion that doesn't require PRs to project code,
anyone can add a new resource available to the LLM or interact with existing resources by creating an 80-line
Python file.

- **Visual transparency:** Our interface has to be rich and clearly display relevant information for the user
to make informed decisions by showing planned tasks, resolved file paths and contents, resorting to clear visual
guidelines to clearly present relevant information. At the same time it's important that the interface's actual
code interface is abstract enough to allow several reasonable alternatives. For example, right now Solveig is a
CLI-focused tool, but there's no real reason not to consider a web interface in the future that offers valuable
features like more customizable looks, media playing, HTML rendering, etc.

- **Industry standards:** Solveig adopts patterns from other leading agentic AI tools and builds upon leading
industry standards. Several features of Solveig were anywhere from inspired to functionally or visually copied 
from other tools - see the [Market Comparison](#market-comparison) above for more.
