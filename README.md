# Solveig

**A safe bridge between AI assistants and your computer.**

Solveig lets LLMs read files and run commands with explicit user approval for every operation.

* **Explicit consent** - Review every file or command request before execution
* **Safety validation** - Shellcheck integration prevents dangerous commands
* **Works anywhere** - Any OpenAI-compatible LLM endpoint (OpenRouter, local models)
* **Simple setup** - Modern Python CLI with comprehensive testing

## ‚ùì FAQ


### What is Solveig?

A terminal AI helper that can request file access and run commands with your explicit approval.

### Is Solveig an LLM like ChatGPT?

No, it's a safe interface between LLM services and your computer. It can use ChatGPT, Claude, or any OpenAI-compatible service.

### Why use Solveig instead of a plain LLM?

LLMs can only work with what you manually provide. If ChatGPT needs a file or command output, you have to copy-paste it yourself. Solveig lets the LLM request exactly what it needs, and you just approve or deny each request.

### Why use Solveig over other LLM‚Äëto‚Äëshell assistants?

Solveig focuses on preventing dangerous operations through explicit user consent and validation. It prefers direct file access over arbitrary commands when possible, and validates commands with Shellcheck before execution.

### Is Solveig safe to run?

Solveig requires your approval for every file read, write, or command execution. It uses Shellcheck to validate commands and catch dangerous patterns. However, you're ultimately responsible for reviewing and denying any request you don't understand.

This is still a tool that connects an AI to your computer - always review what it wants to do.

I can tell you the current time by checking the system clock. Let me run the date command to get the current time and date.

The system shows 01:24 AM EEST (Eastern European Summer Time). Hong Kong is 5 hours ahead of EEST, so the time in Hong Kong is 06:24 AM HKT.

I need to examine the ~/run.sh file to determine if it's dangerous. Let me check its contents and metadata to see what it does.

--- Assistant ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The ~/run.sh file appears to be safe. It's a simple initialization script that creates directories for logs and tmp files, creates an empty log file, and sets up a flag file indicating the project has been initialized. The commands are all basic file operations (mkdir, touch, echo) and don't contain any suspicious or dangerous operations.

I'll create a Dockerized FastAPI example project in ~/my_app/. This will include the FastAPI application code, requirements, Dockerfile, and docker-compose configuration.

## üß© Plugins

Solveig can be extended by adding new communication capabilities or by interacting
with existing messages. A plugin can work in one of two ways:

* You can add a new message that describes a functionality available for the LLM. You can do this by creating a
`Pydantic` model that extends `schema.requirement.Requirement` and returns a response extending
`schema.requirement.RequirementResult`. **This functionality is not implemented yet since it requires figuring out
a way to re-generate the schema sent to the LLM on runtime, after all plugins are registered**
* You can interact with an existing requirement message, either before or after it starts being resolved, by using
the `@before/after(requirements=None)` hooks. Check out the existing `Shellcheck` plugin or the examples below


### Examples:

<details>
<summary><b>Anonymize all paths before sending to LLM</b></summary>

```python
import re

from solveig.config import SolveigConfig
from solveig.plugins.hooks import after
from solveig.schema.requirement import ReadRequirement, WriteRequirement, ReadResult, WriteResult

@after(requirements=(ReadRequirement, WriteRequirement))
def anonymize_paths(config: SolveigConfig, requirement: ReadRequirement|WriteRequirement, result: ReadResult|WriteResult):
    anonymous_path = result.real_path
    anonymous_path = re.sub(r"/home/\w+?", "/home/jdoe/", anonymous_path)
    anonymous_path = re.sub(r"^([A-Z]:\\Users\\)[^\\]+", r"\1JohnDoe", anonymous_path, flags=re.IGNORECASE)
    result.real_path = anonymous_path
```

## üìà Roadmap

**Next Steps:**
- Additional file operations (copy, move, delete)
- Enhanced command validation with Semgrep static analysis  
- Second-opinion LLM validation for generated commands

**Future Ideas:**
- Direct API integration for Claude/Gemini
- Advanced plugin ecosystem with custom requirement types
